# Diabetes Onset Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset in patients using machine learning models, with a special focus on **Logistic Regression** and **Feature Engineering**. We’ve also explored additional models, including **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest**, comparing their performance to determine the most effective model for predicting diabetes onset. Based on our evaluation metrics, **Logistic Regression** showed the highest accuracy and efficiency for this dataset.

## Project Overview

Diabetes is a significant health issue worldwide, affecting millions of people. Early prediction of diabetes onset can be critical for managing symptoms and improving patient outcomes. In this project, we applied machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the likelihood of diabetes onset using the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**. 

### Objectives

- To predict diabetes onset using patient health data.
- To compare multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
- To demonstrate the effectiveness of **Logistic Regression** over other classification models.

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Preparation and Exploration**
   - **Data Cleaning**: Checked and handled missing values.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and key patterns in the dataset.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Feature Scaling**: Standardized data for model consistency.
   - **Feature Creation**: Tested with different feature combinations to improve prediction accuracy.

### 3. **Model Building**
   - **Logistic Regression**: Focus model for prediction.
   - **Additional Models**: Trained **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest** for comparison.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Accuracy**: Correct predictions over the total predictions.
   - **Precision, Recall, F1-score**: Evaluated model sensitivity and predictive power.
   - **ROC-AUC**: Assessed model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized model performance in correct vs. incorrect predictions.

### 5. **Model Comparison**
   - **ROC Curves**: Plotted and compared ROC-AUC scores of all models.
   - **Model Comparison Graph**: Showcased the superior performance of Logistic Regression over other models.
